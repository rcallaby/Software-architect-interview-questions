# Technical Debt & Trade-Offs in Software Architecture Interviews

Every architecture involves **compromises**. Limited budgets, delivery deadlines, evolving requirements, and resource constraints often force architects to balance ideal design with practical realities. This is where **technical debt** and **trade-offs** become central topics in interviews.

## Why Interviewers Ask About This

Hiring managers and technical panels want to know if you can:

* **Identify technical debt** before it becomes a critical risk.
* **Explain trade-offs clearly** to both technical teams and business stakeholders.
* **Balance short-term delivery** needs with **long-term maintainability**.
* **Prioritize debt repayment** in alignment with business objectives.
* **Make data-informed decisions** instead of relying only on intuition.

## Core Areas of Focus

When preparing for this section, expect questions that probe your ability to:

* **Define technical debt** in measurable terms (e.g., slower feature velocity, higher defect rates, escalating maintenance costs).
* **Differentiate between deliberate and accidental debt** â€” intentional shortcuts vs. poor practices.
* **Evaluate trade-offs** across performance, scalability, cost, and maintainability.
* **Communicate risks** of technical debt to non-technical stakeholders.
* **Decide when to refactor** vs. when to accept debt as a strategic compromise.
* **Leverage metrics** (e.g., code complexity, bug density, cycle time) to justify decisions.

## What Strong Candidates Demonstrate

Architects who excel in this area show that they can **navigate ambiguity and constraints**, making **transparent, justifiable decisions** rather than chasing perfection. They frame trade-offs not as failures, but as **strategic choices** that align technology with business needs while maintaining a plan for long-term system health.
