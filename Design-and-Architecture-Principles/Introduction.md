# Introduction: Design and Architecture Principles

This section covers the foundational principles and established frameworks that guide sound software architecture. Core design tenets such as modularity, separation of concerns, abstraction, and scalability are explored in the context of building systems that are adaptable and resilient. Practical frameworks and patterns are also highlighted, including the **SOLID principles** for object-oriented design, **domain-driven design (DDD)** for aligning systems with business domains, and **hexagonal or layered architectures** for structuring boundaries and dependencies. Attention is given to cross-cutting concerns such as maintainability, performance, and fault tolerance, alongside design choices that support long-term sustainability. Together, these principles and patterns provide a toolkit for creating architectures that balance complexity with clarity and flexibility.
