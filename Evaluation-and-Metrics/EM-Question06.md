# EM - Question 06 - What metrics can be used to assess the maintainability of a software architecture, and how do they influence design decisions? 

Several metrics can be used to assess the maintainability of a software architecture. These metrics generally fall into categories that measure **complexity**, **coupling**, and **cohesion**. They provide a quantitative basis for evaluating a system's quality and help guide design decisions to improve its long-term viability.

### 1. Cyclomatic Complexity

**Cyclomatic complexity** measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. It's a metric often applied at the function or method level but can also be used to assess the complexity of larger architectural components. A higher value indicates a more complex and potentially difficult-to-maintain component because it suggests a greater number of conditional statements and decision points.

**Influence on Design Decisions:**

* **Refactoring:** High complexity in a module or function is a strong signal for refactoring. Architects may decide to break down a complex component into several smaller, more focused ones to reduce its complexity.
* **Testing Strategy:** Components with high cyclomatic complexity require more thorough testing to cover all possible execution paths, influencing test-driven development (TDD) strategies and resource allocation for quality assurance.

### 2. Coupling

**Coupling** measures the degree of interdependence between software modules. Low coupling is desirable as it indicates that changes in one module are less likely to affect others, making the system easier to understand and modify. There are various types of coupling, including:

* **Data Coupling:** Modules share data through parameters.
* **Stamp Coupling:** Modules share a data structure, but only a portion is used.
* **Control Coupling:** One module passes control information to another.
* **Content Coupling:** One module directly modifies the internal data of another.

**Influence on Design Decisions:**

* **Service Boundaries:** Architects use coupling metrics to define the boundaries of services or microservices. A goal is to minimize dependencies between services, ensuring they can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.
* **Dependency Injection:** Low-coupling designs often rely on patterns like Dependency Injection to manage dependencies, making components more interchangeable and testable.

### 3. Cohesion

**Cohesion** measures the degree to which the elements within a module belong together. High cohesion is a sign of a well-designed module, where all elements are focused on a single, well-defined task.

* **Functional Cohesion:** All elements contribute to a single, well-defined function. This is the highest and most desirable form of cohesion.
* **Sequential Cohesion:** The output of one element serves as the input for the next.
* **Logical Cohesion:** Elements are related by a logical function, but not all are executed.

**Influence on Design Decisions:**

* **Module Design:** A low-cohesion score suggests that a module is performing multiple, unrelated tasks. This is a clear indicator that the module should be split into smaller, more focused components.
* **Architectural Patterns:** High cohesion is a fundamental principle in various architectural patterns like the **Microservices Architecture**, where each service is responsible for a single, well-defined business capability.

### 4. Other Metrics

* **Technical Debt:** While not a direct metric, it's a critical concept. It represents the "cost" of future rework caused by choosing an easy but suboptimal solution today. Tools that measure code complexity and other metrics can help quantify technical debt, influencing decisions to prioritize refactoring efforts.
* **Code Duplication:** High levels of duplicated code increase maintenance costs as every change must be applied in multiple places. Tools for static analysis can detect duplication, informing decisions to create reusable libraries or components.
* **Maintainability Index (MI):** This is a composite metric often calculated by combining factors like cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, and Halstead complexity. It provides a single score (typically on a scale of 0 to 100) that indicates the maintainability of a component, with a higher score being better.

These metrics provide a quantitative framework for architects and developers to evaluate the health of a software system. By consistently monitoring and addressing issues highlighted by these metrics, a team can make proactive design decisions that lead to a more robust, scalable, and maintainable software architecture.
